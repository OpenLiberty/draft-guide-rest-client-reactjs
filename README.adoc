== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to access a REST service and deserialize the returned JSON that contains a list of artists, their albums and other ambiguous artist features by using an HTTP client with the ReactJS library. You will then present this data using a ReactJS element in the form of a paginated table.

https://reactjs.org/[ReactJS^] is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Its main purpose is to incorporate a component-based approach to create reusable UI elements. https://reactjs.org/[ReactJS^] also allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. Note, the names ReactJS and React are used interchangeably.

The React application in this guide is provided and configured for you in the `frontend` directory. The application uses the https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html[Create React App] prebuilt configuration to design the modern single-page React application. The [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app]`create-react-app` integrated toolchain is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

artists.json
[source, json, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/resources/artists.json[]
----

The REST service that provides the resources was written for you in advance in the backend of the application, and responds with the [hotspot]`artists.json` in `src/resources`. You will implement a ReactJS client that consumes this JSON and displays its contents on a single-page webpage, which will act as your application's frontend. 

To learn more about REST services and how you can write them, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service^].

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed. The React frontend is already pre-built for you and the static files from the production build can be found in `webapp/static`.

To try out the application, run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message, your application server is ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Then, point your browser to the web application root http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] to see the following output:

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the service
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the service

Before you begin the implementation, start the provided REST service so that
the artist JSON is available to you.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

After you start the service, you can find your artist JSON at the
http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^] URL. 

Note: all the other dependencies that are installed in the project will show up in `frontend/src/package.json`
that was generated using `create-react-app`. There are also pre-coded style sheet files that can be found in `frontend/src/Styles`.

// =================================================================================================
// Project Configuration 
// =================================================================================================

== Project Configuration

The static files that will be produced from the optimized production build are generated through the [hotspot=node-resources]`node resources`, and they are sent to the backend of the application.

The [hotspot=copy-plugin]`Maven resource plugin` in the `pom.xml` is the configuration that will copy the frontend static files to target directory. 

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

=== Creating the default page

You need to create the entry point of your React application. In production, when the frontend application is used by other applications, the [hotspot file]`index.js` file should be the main entry point of the application as it coincides with the `index.html` file. This is where your code is always going to be run. 

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]

#Create the `index.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src`
----

index.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/index.js[]
----

The [hotspot=import-react]`React library` imports the `default export` from the react package.
The performance benefit in using React is evident through the Virtual DOM that it offers, which is essentially a copy of the browser DOM that resides in memory. The Virtual DOM improves the performance of your web application as it plays a crucial role in the rendering process. The [hotspot=react-dom]`ReactDOM` package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used in your application to get outside of the React model, if necessary. Here, you are rendering the the `App` 
element on a DOM node using the [hotspot=dom-render]`render` method. 
See, https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html[ReactDOM^] to learn more about the Virtual DOM.

You will also notice the `serviceWorker.js` file included in `frontend/src`. This JavaScript file is used to register a service worker. A service worker is essentially a web API that offers offline capabilities. This file is invoked by in using `create-react-app`. By default, it will not control your application as it is [hotspot=service-worker]`unregistered` in the `index.js`. 

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the React components
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the React components

A React web application is simply a collection of components. Each component does a specific functionality. You will create the components that are used in the application to acquire and display data from the REST API. 

App.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/App.js[]
----

Fetchdata.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=get-posts,mount-posts,axios-library']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js[]
----

The main component in your React application is the `App` Component. You will need to create the [hotspot file=0]`App.js` file which acts as a container for all other components. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `App.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/App.js`
----

The `App.js` file returns the `FetchData` component as a [hotspot=react-fragment file=0]`React Fragment` to create a reusable element that encompasses your web application. 

Next, you will create the `FetchData` component that will define the states and properties of your react webpage. 
[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `Fetchdata.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js`
----
The [hotspot=react-library file=1]`React library` imports the `default export`, as well as the `component named export` from the `react` package so you can create the [hotspot=class file=1]`Fetchdata` component as an inheritance of the `React Component`. The [hotspot=state-object file=1]`state` object is initialized to represent the state of the posts that will appear on the paginated table. The `Fetchdata` component also needs to be [hotspot=export-fetchdata file=1]`exported` as a reusable UI element that can be used across your application.

To display the returned data, you will use the practice of pagination. Pagination is the process of separating content into discrete pages, and it can be used for handling data sets in React. In your application, you will render the columns in the paginated table. The [hotspot=table-info file=1]`columns` constant is used to define the table present on the webpage.

The [hotspot=return-table file=1]`return` statement adds the paginated table to your application. Your paginated table is returned as a `<React.Fragment>`, where you have defined the properties for the [hotspot=table file=1]`ReactTable`. The [hotspot=posts file=1]`{posts}` prop corresponds to the consumed data from the API endpoint and is assigned to the `data` of the table. The [hotspot=columns file=1]`{column}` prop corresponds to the rendered column object and is assigned to the `columns` of the table.

// =================================================================================================
// Importing the HTTP client
// =================================================================================================

=== Importing The HTTP client

Your application needs a way to communicate with RESTful web services to retrieve their
resources in order to output the resources onto the paginated table. You will use the https://github.com/axios/axios[axios^] library to provide you with an HTTP client. This client will be used to make HTTP requests to external resources. https://github.com/axios/axios[Axios^] is a promise-based HTTP client that allows you to send asynchronous requests to REST endpoints. Unlike frameworks such as Angular that have a built-in HTTP client, you need to use a third-party vendor HTTP client to render data from an API endpoint. To learn more about the axios library and its HTTP client, visit the https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios[axios documentation^].

Fetchdata.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js[]
----

The [hotspot=get-posts]`getPosts()` function will utilize the axios API. You also  need to verify that the component was updated properly. This is done through the [hotspot=mount-posts]`componentDidMount()` lifecycle method.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `Fetchdata.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Add the [hotspot=axios-library]`axios library` and the [hotspot=get-posts]`getPosts()` function. 
Next, add the [hotspot=mount-posts]`componentDidMount()` method into your Component. 

The [hotspot=axios]`axios` HTTP call is used to read the artist JSON
containing the data from the sample JSON file in `resources`. 
On successfully getting a response, the state of the system changes by 
assigning [hotspot=data]`response.data` to [hotspot=data]`posts`. 
The [hotspot=convert-data]`convertData` function manipulates the 
JSON data, to allow it to be accessed by the `ReactTable`.

Once the state is updated, your component will mount all the children elements and component instances to the native UI. You will now have access to the native UI, and will be able to access to your children references, with the ability to trigger a new render pass.

// =================================================================================================
// Building the frontend
// =================================================================================================

== Building the frontend

On successfully building your components, you need to build the 
frontend by running the Maven `generate-resources` goal:
[role='command']
----
mvn generate-resources
----

Note that you can rebuild the frontend at any time with the Maven `generate-resources` goal.
Any local changes to your JavaScript and HTML are picked up when you build the
frontend.

Navigate to the http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] URL to view your frontend application.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the React client
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the React client

When you create a new project with `create-react-app`, it comes with a test file
called [hotspot file]`App.test.js` which is included in `frontend/src`. This is a simple JavaScript file that tests against the `App.js` component. There are no explicit test cases written for this application. Similar to the purpose in using the `axios` HTTP-client, React does not have a built-in test runner.
The `create-react-app` configuration uses https://jestjs.io/[Jest^] as it's test runner. To learn more about Jest, follow their documentation on https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react[Testing React Apps^]. 

App.test.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/App.test.js[]
----

Although the React application in this guide is simple, when you build more complex React applications, testing becomes a crucial part of your development lifecycle. If you need to write application oriented test cases, follow the official unit testing and end-to-end testing documentation on the official https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html[React testing document^].
