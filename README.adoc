== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to access a REST service and deserialize the returned JSON that contains a list of artists, their albums and other ambiguous artist features by using an HTTP client with the ReactJS library. You will then present this data using a ReactJS element in the form of a paginated table.

https://reactjs.org/[ReactJS^] is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Its main purpose is to incorporate a component-based approach to create reusable UI elements. https://reactjs.org/[ReactJS^] also allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. Note, the names ReactJS and React are used interchangeably.

The React application in this guide is provided and configured for you in the `frontend` directory. The application uses the https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html[Create React App] prebuilt configuration to design the modern single-page React application. The [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app]`create-react-app` integrated toolchain is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

artists.json
[source, json, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/resources/artists.json[]
----

The REST service that provides the resources was written for you in advance in the backend of the application, and responds with the [hotspot]`artists.json` in `src/resources`. You will implement a ReactJS client that consumes this JSON and displays its contents on a single-page webpage, which will act as your application's frontend. 

To learn more about REST services and how you can write them, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service^].

// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and build your React frontend:

[role='command']
```
mvn generate-resources
```

Run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message, your application server is ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Then, point your browser to the web application root http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] to see the following output:

image::react-table.png[React Paginated Table,align="center"]

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/twyb-end.adoc[]

Also, pressing CTRL+C in the shell session that deploys the frontend application will stop the node server. 

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the service
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the service

Before you begin the implementation, start the provided REST service so that
the artist JSON is available to you.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

First, you need to build the frontend by running the Maven `generate-resources` goal:
[role='command']
----
mvn generate-resources
----

Note that you can rebuild the frontend at any time with the Maven `generate-resources` goal.
Any local changes to your JaveScript and HTML are picked up when you build the
frontend.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

After you start the service, you can find your artist JSON at the
http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^] URL.

server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----
Also, because you will be requesting data from a different domain, you need to incorporate 
Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Open liberty has a built-in configuration 
for CORS that can be added to the `server.xml`
See https://openliberty.io/guides/cors.html[Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)^] to learn more about CORS.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `server.xml` file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Add the [hotspot=cors file=0]`CORS` configuration.

Note: all the other dependencies that are installed in the project will show up in `frontend/src/package.json`.

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the React component
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the React component

A React web application is simply a collection of components. Each component does a specific functionality. You will create the component that is used in the application to acquire and display data from the REST API. 

Fetchdata.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=axios-library,react-table,get-posts,mount-posts,render-posts']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js[]
----

App.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/App.js[]
----

index.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/index.js[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `Fetchdata.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js`
----

The [hotspot=react-library file=0]`React library` imports the default export from the `react` package, and the component named export from the package. An inheritance to the React Component is created to write the [hotspot=class file=0]`Fetchdata` component. 


The object to represent the [hotspot=state-object file=0]`state` of the posts that will appear on the paginated table. The `Fetchdata` component also needs to be [hotspot=export-fetchdata file=0]`exported` as a reusable UI element that can be used across your application, such as in the [hotspot=import-Fetchdata file=1]`App.js` file. The `App.js` file has been provided for you, and it returns the `Fetchdata` component as a [hotspot=react-fragment file=1]`React Fragment` to create a reusable element that encompasses your whole web application. 

The entry point of your application is the [hotspot file=2]`index.js` file, and this is where your code is always going to be run. The performance benefit in using ReactJS is evident through the Virtual DOM that it offers, which is essentially a copy of the browser DOM that resides in memory. The Virtual DOM improves the performance of your web application as it plays a crucial role in the rendering process. The https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html[react-dom^] package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used in your application to get outside of the React model, if necessary. See, https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html[ReactDOM^] to learn more about the Virtual DOM. 

To render the element that was made onto your webpage, the [hotspot=dom-render file=2]`render` method is provided by the DOM. Here, we rendered the `App` element on a DOM node.

// =================================================================================================
// Importing the HTTP client
// =================================================================================================

== Importing the HTTP client

Your application needs a way to communicate with RESTful web services to retrieve their
resources. In this section, you will use the https://github.com/axios/axios[axios^] library to provide you with an HTTP client. This client will be used to make HTTP requests to external resources. https://github.com/axios/axios[Axios^] is a promise-based HTTP client that allows you to send asynchronous requests to REST endpoints. Unlike frameworks such as Angular that have a built-in HTTP client, we need to use a third-party vendor HTTP client to render data from an API endpoint. To learn more about the axios library and its HTTP client, visit the https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios[axios documentation^].

Begin by importing the [hotspot=axios-library]`axios` Library into the `Fetchdata` Component.

Fetchdata.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=react-table,mount-posts,render-posts']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js[]
----

The [hotspot=get-posts]`getPosts()` is the function that will utilize the axios API.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `Fetchdata.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Add the [hotspot=get-posts]`getPosts()` function into the Fetchdata Component. 
Import the [hotspot=axios]`axios` HTTP call to read the artist JSON
containing the data from the sample JSON files. Then, you can
change the loading state by using the [hotspot=then-method]`.then()` method 
to display the data. On successfully getting a response, the state of 
the system changes by assigning [hotspot=data]`response.data` to [hotspot=data]`posts`.
Lastly, import the [hotspot=error-handling]`error` statement.

Since axios is promise-based, you can still use the [hotspot=error-handling]`.catch()` method that is used for 
error handling in promise composition. A benefit of axios is that it will reject the request promise 
if a `4xx` or `5xx` series error is returned.

// =================================================================================================
// Displaying the returned data 
// =================================================================================================

== Displaying the returned data
In this section, we will verify that the component was updated properly and then display the returned artist data. Once the state is updated, your component will mount all the children elements and component instances to the native UI. You will now have access to the native UI, and will be able to access to your children references and the ability to trigger a new render pass. You will use the concept of pagination to display the returned data. Pagination is the process of separating content into discrete pages, and it can be used for handling data sets in React. In your application, you will render the columns in the paginated table. 

Start by importing the [hotspot=react-table]`react table` libraries needed for the paginated table.

Fetchdata.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `Fetchdata.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/Fetchdata.js`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Add the [hotspot=mount-posts]`componentDidMount()` lifecycle method and [hotspot=render-posts]`render()` 
method to your component. 

The [hotspot=table-info]`columns` constant is used to define the table present on the webpage. The table is split into two major sections, the [hotspot=tag:header-artist]`Artist Info Header` and the[hotspot=tag:header-album]`Albums Header`. Each section defines the appropriate [hotspot=header-ID hotspot=header-name hotspot=header-genres hotspot=header-title hotspot=header-tracks]`Headers` 
and [hotspot=accessor-ID hotspot=accessor-name hotspot=accessor-followers hotspot=accessor-genres hotspot=accessor-title hotspot=accessor-tracks]`accessors` that corresponds to the `resources/artists.json`.

You will create the [hotspot=convert-data]`convertData` function that will manipulate the JSON data, to allow it to be accessed.  

The [hotspot=return-table]`return` statement adds the paginated table to your application. Your paginated table is returned as `<React.Fragment>`, where you have defined the properties for the paginated [hotspot=table]`table`. The property [hotspot=posts]`{posts}` corresponds to the consumed data from the API endpoint and is assigned to the `data` of the table. The property [hotspot=columns]`{column}` corresponds to the rendered column object and is assigned to the `columns` of the table.

Navigate to the http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] URL to view your frontend application.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the React client
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the React client

No explicit code directly uses the consumed artist JSON, so you don’t need to write any test cases.

Whenever you change and build your React implementation, the frontend application at http://localhost:9080 reflects the changes automatically. You can visit the URL to manually check whether the artist JSON was consumed correctly. You can rebuild only your React frontend by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
mvn generate-resources
```

When you are done checking the application root, exit development mode by pressing CTRL+C in the shell session where you ran the server, or by typing q and then pressing the enter/return key. Likewise, pressing CTRL+C in the shell session that deployed your frontend application will stop the node server. 

Although the React application in this guide is simple, when you build more complex React applications, testing becomes a crucial part of your development lifecycle. If you need to write test cases, follow the official unit testing and end-to-end testing documentation on the official https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html[React testing document^].
